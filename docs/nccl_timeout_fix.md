# Fix for NCCL Collective Timeout in Multi-GPU Training

## Issue Description

Training fails with NCCL collective operation timeout errors in multi-GPU setups:

```
[rank6]:[E921 03:35:20.399015003 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:685] [Rank 6] Watchdog caught collective operation timeout: WorkNCCL(SeqNum=18723, OpType=ALLREDUCE, NumelIn=1, NumelOut=1, Timeout(ms)=600000) ran for 600017 milliseconds before timing out.
```

This occurs when one or more processes lag behind in the training loop, causing NCCL collectives to timeout while waiting for synchronization.

## Root Cause

The timeout happens during gradient synchronization in DDP. The issue is caused by inefficient computation of gradient and parameter norms for progress bar display and wandb logging. The original implementation used GPU computation which, while keeping GPU utilization high, was slow and caused process lag leading to NCCL timeouts.

## Solution

Replace the tensor stacking approach with an efficient CPU-based accumulation loop that avoids creating large intermediate tensors and prevents GPU utilization drops:

### Fixed Code

```python
# Compute grad_norm and param_norm efficiently on CPU
grad_sq_sum = torch.tensor(0.)  # CPU tensor
param_sq_sum = torch.tensor(0.)  # CPU tensor
for p in parameters:
    if p.grad is not None:
        grad_sq_sum += (p.grad.detach().cpu() ** 2).sum()
    param_sq_sum += (p.detach().cpu() ** 2).sum()
grad_norm = torch.sqrt(grad_sq_sum)
param_norm = torch.sqrt(param_sq_sum)
```

## Why This Works

- **Memory Efficiency**: Avoids stacking large tensors that can cause memory pressure
- **Computational Efficiency**: Reduces computation time by avoiding redundant norm operations and using CPU
- **Synchronization Safety**: Faster computation prevents process lag that triggers NCCL timeouts
- **GPU Utilization**: Keeps GPU at 100% utilization by offloading monitoring computations to CPU
- **Scalability**: Performance improvement becomes more significant with larger models

## Technical Details

NCCL collectives require all processes to participate simultaneously. When computing norms for monitoring, slow operations on any process can cause the entire collective to timeout. The original stacking approach creates O(num_parameters) tensors and performs redundant norm calculations, while the fixed approach accumulates sums in O(1) space with a single square root operation.

## Testing

After applying this fix, multi-GPU training should continue without NCCL timeout errors. The progress bar and wandb logging will display the same metrics with improved performance and reliability. GPU utilization should remain consistently high (near 100%) during training, as the monitoring computations are offloaded to CPU.

## Additional Recommendations

If timeouts persist, consider:

1. **Increase NCCL Timeout**: Set environment variable `NCCL_TIMEOUT=1200000` (20 minutes)
2. **Reduce Batch Size**: Smaller batches may reduce computation variance between processes
3. **Use Gradient Clipping**: Ensure `max_grad_norm` is set appropriately to prevent gradient explosions
4. **Profile Performance**: Check for load imbalance between GPUs
5. **Offline Wandb Logging**: Set `WANDB_MODE=offline` to avoid network delays during logging that can cause GPU utilization instability
6. **Reduce Monitoring Frequency**: Consider updating progress bar less frequently (e.g., every 10 steps) to reduce CPU overhead on the main process</content>
